OVERVIEW

The Password Complexity Checker helps users ensure their passwords meet recommended security guidelines. It categorizes passwords as:
     
 - Strong: Meets all complexity requirements. 
 - Moderate: Meets most but not all criteria.
 - Weak: Needs significant improvement.
 - Very Weak: Highly insecure.

   FEATURES

   Checks if a password has:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character

  HOW IT WORKS

The script evaluates the password using regular expressions:
a. It checks the password for specific patterns (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
b. Based on the number of criteria met, it classifies the password into one of four categories:
	•	Strong
	•	Moderate
	•	Weak
	•	Very Weak
