OVERVIEW

The Password Complexity Checker helps users ensure their passwords meet recommended security guidelines. It categorizes passwords as:
     
 - Strong: Meets all complexity requirements. 
 - Moderate: Meets most but not all criteria.
 - Weak: Needs significant improvement.
 - Very Weak: Highly insecure.

   FEATURES

   Checks if a password has:
- Minimum length of 8 characters

  HOW IT WORKS

a. It checks the password for specific patterns (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).

b. Based on the number of criteria met, it classifies the password into one of four categories:

  - Weak
  - Very Weak
